# do NOT fucking DIE

This repository hosts the source code of the game dNfD (second version).

The afformentioned source code is itself based on a starter-kit template project in which my recent GMS projects have been built on top of. Hence the sheer size and unused assets in there.

This project was made with a Google Sites wiki, and a Trello board. Both of these may remain private due to the personal and sensitive-information aspect of both boards.

When I wrote this code, only god and i knew how it worked. Now, only he knows.
